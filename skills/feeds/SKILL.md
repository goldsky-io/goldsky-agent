description: "Query Goldsky Feeds, the REST API for one wallet's balances and transfers. Use for wallet holdings, portfolio value, transfer history, deposit checks, edge.goldsky.com/data/feeds, a Feeds API key, or GOLDSKY_FEEDS_API_KEY.

For JSON-RPC, use /edge or /boost."

# Goldsky Feeds

Feeds answers one question about one wallet over HTTP: what it holds, or what it sent and received, across the supported chains in a single request. Goldsky indexes, normalizes, and prices the rows. The caller does not run a pipeline.

The installed CLI has no feeds command. Do not look for `goldsky feeds`, and do not mint the key with `goldsky edge create`. The endpoint name `feeds` is reserved on the Edge create path, so that command is rejected. The CLI login token is a different credential and does not authenticate these requests.

## When this is the wrong tool

- The rows need to land in the user's own database or webhook. That is a Turbo pipeline (`/turbo-builder`, `/datasets`). Feeds does not stream into a sink; streaming is not offered yet (https://docs.goldsky.com/feeds/streaming).
- The question is a Turbo dataset name or chain prefix. That is `/datasets`. Those prefixes differ: Feeds says `polygon` and `arbitrum_one`, Turbo says `matic` and `arbitrum`.
- The question is JSON-RPC. That is `/edge`, or `/boost` when they want to keep their current provider.

## Key

A project has one Feeds key, and every feed answers it. Creating that key is the setup. Do it with the API. Do not send the user to the dashboard, and do not run `goldsky edge create`.

The call authenticates with the project token from `goldsky login`, which is stored at `~/.goldsky/auth_token`. Do not read that file into the chat, do not pass `--token`, and do not ask the user to paste a token. If `goldsky project list` says they are not logged in, use `/auth-setup` first. The caller has to be an Editor on the project.

```bash
create_raw=$(curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat "$HOME/.goldsky/auth_token")" \
  -w '\n%{http_code}' \
  https://api.goldsky.com/api/v1/feeds/api-key)
printf '%s\n' "${create_raw##*$'\n'}"
```

Do not print `create_raw`. The line above is the HTTP status. The rest of the variable is `{ "data": { "name": "feeds", "api_key": "<plaintext or null>" } }`.

- When `api_key` is a string, that call created the key. Export it as `GOLDSKY_FEEDS_API_KEY`. Do not print it, and do not write it into a file.
- When `api_key` is null, the project already has the key and this endpoint will not return it again. Reveal it, export `.data.api_key`, and do not print that response either. The reveal body is `{ "data": { "api_key": "<plaintext>" } }` and has no `name`. Run this only in that case:

```bash
reveal_raw=$(curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat "$HOME/.goldsky/auth_token")" \
  -w '\n%{http_code}' \
  https://api.goldsky.com/api/v1/edge/feeds/api-key)
printf '%s\n' "${reveal_raw##*$'\n'}"
```

Do not call `POST /api/v1/feeds/key/rotate` unless the user asks: rotate revokes the current key immediately.

- 401 means they are not logged in. Use `/auth-setup`.
- 403 means this user is not an Editor on the project.
- 409 means an Edge endpoint named `feeds` exists and is not the Feeds key. That endpoint has to be deleted before this call can create one.

A 401, 403, or 409 body is an error and has no key, so it can be shown. A 200 body has the key, so leave it in the variable.

Send `GOLDSKY_FEEDS_API_KEY` in the `x-api-key` header. `?key=` and `Authorization: Bearer` are also accepted on the feed itself. Prefer the header so the key does not land in a URL log.

The codes above are the mint and reveal calls. The feed itself answers a missing key with 402 and an x402 payment-required body, not 401, because that path is also offered pay-per-request. A key that is present but wrong is 401. So on a 402, the header did not arrive; re-read it before assuming the key is bad.

## Calls

Read https://edge.goldsky.com/data/openapi.json before using a parameter or response field that the quickstart does not show. That document is the contract. The guide is https://docs.goldsky.com/feeds/quickstart and the overview is https://docs.goldsky.com/feeds.

Balances returns the latest balance of each token the wallet holds, native assets included, plus `total_value_usd`:

```bash
curl -sS -H "x-api-key: $GOLDSKY_FEEDS_API_KEY" \
  "https://edge.goldsky.com/data/feeds/wallets/balances?address=0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
```

Transfers returns that wallet's movements, newest first. `direction` is `in` or `out` relative to `address`:

```bash
curl -sS -H "x-api-key: $GOLDSKY_FEEDS_API_KEY" \
  "https://edge.goldsky.com/data/feeds/wallets/transfers?address=0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
```

`address` is required and is exactly one wallet. An EVM address is `0x` plus 40 hex digits. A base58 Solana address passes validation but has no chain behind it yet, so it answers 200 with an empty `data`. A non-200 body is an error, not an empty wallet.

## Parameters

Re-read the OpenAPI spec when a request is rejected. The chain set lives on the `chains` parameter there.

- Omit `chains` to query every supported chain. Pass canonical slugs, comma-separated. `matic`, `arbitrum`, and `mainnet` are aliases for `polygon`, `arbitrum_one`, and `ethereum`. Matching is case-insensitive, and `-` is read as `_`. Any other spelling returns 400.
- `token_symbol` matches a symbol, so two contracts can both match. Use `token_address` when the token must be a specific contract. On balances, the zero address selects the native asset.
- `include_unknown_price` defaults to false, which leaves out tokens Goldsky has no price *source* for. It is not a promise that every row is priced: at the default, rows whose token is priceable still come back with `price_usd` and `value_usd` null. Handle a null price on every row.
- `min_value_usd` drops rows below that USD value and also drops unpriced rows. It applies to `total_value_usd` too.
- On transfers, `from` and `to` are inclusive RFC 3339 bounds on `block_timestamp`. `from_block` and `to_block` require exactly one chain, because block numbers are not comparable across chains; without one they are 422 `CONFLICTING_FILTERS`, not 400. `transfer_type` is `native`, `erc20`, or both, comma-separated. The NFT types (`erc721`, `erc1155`) return 400. `spl` is accepted and returns 200 with an empty `data`, because no Solana chain is served yet: that empty page means the filter matched nothing on the EVM chains, not that the wallet is empty. `direction` is `in` or `out`.
- `page_size` defaults to 100 and the maximum is 1000. A larger value is clamped to 1000 rather than rejected, so read `pagination.page_size` back instead of assuming the request size was honored. The next page is `page_token` set to the previous response's `pagination.next_page_token`. A token is only valid for the filters that produced it. Each page is a separate billed request (https://docs.goldsky.com/pricing/summary#feeds). Do not walk the whole history unless the user asked for that range.

## Writing code against a response

- Balances are the latest amount of each token, not a history. Several transfers in one block become one balance row. Reconstruct movement from the transfers feed.
- A transfer object has no id. Do not build a primary key that includes `block_number` or `block_timestamp`: a transaction that survives a reorg comes back with different block fields. Do not assume one transaction emits a transfer only once.
- `price_usd` and `amount_usd` are computed when the request is served. A later read of the same transfer can show a different USD value.
