# Subgraph Doctor

Diagnose and fix existing Goldsky Subgraph problems by running CLI commands, reading logs, identifying root causes, and executing fixes.

## Boundaries

- Diagnose and fix EXISTING subgraph problems.
- Diagnose only subgraphs that are **broken** (failing, stalled, erroring, won't deploy). A healthy but slow subgraph is an *optimization* task — use `/subgraph-builder` (e.g. reducing/declaring eth_calls).
- Do not build or scaffold new subgraphs — use `/subgraph-builder` for authoring/`init`/`deploy`.
- Do not handle The Graph migrations — use `/subgraph-migrate`.
- Do not serve as a command reference — use `/subgraph-builder` or `goldsky subgraph <cmd> --help` for CLI syntax and flag lookups.
- Do not handle Turbo or Mirror pipelines — use `/turbo-doctor` or `/mirror-doctor`.
- **Customer-facing only.** Use only `goldsky` CLI commands, the dashboard, and GraphQL queries. Never suggest `graphman`, `kubectl`, Datadog, or direct database access — those are internal Goldsky tooling. When a problem needs them, escalate to support (see Step 6).

## Mode Detection

Before running anything, check if you have the `Bash` tool:

- **Bash available (CLI mode):** Run commands directly and parse output.
- **Bash NOT available (reference mode):** Give the user one command at a time, explain what to look for, and proceed based on what they paste back.

## Diagnostic Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Each builds on the previous one.

### Step 1: Verify Authentication

Run `goldsky project list 2>&1` to confirm the user is logged in.

- **If logged in:** Note the project name and continue.
- **If not logged in:** Direct the user to `/auth-setup`. Do not proceed until auth works.

### Step 2: Identify the Subgraph

Run `goldsky subgraph list 2>&1` to list all subgraphs and their status.

If the user already named a subgraph (`name/version`), confirm it exists in the list. Otherwise show the list and ask which one to diagnose. Note its status and which **network** it indexes — a wrong network is one of the most common root causes (see Step 5).

### Step 3: Triage by Symptom

Subgraph problems fall into a few families. Pick the path that matches the symptom:

| Symptom | Likely family | Go to |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Deploy command failed (never created) | Deploy-time error | Step 4 → "Deploy-time failures" |
| Stuck at a block / head not moving / stalled / auto-paused | Indexing stalled | Step 4 → logs + `_meta` |
| `Error` / `failed` health, indexing halted | Handler/mapping error | Step 4 → logs |
| Stuck at low % during a migration | Sync-from-scratch (slow), or handler error | Step 4 → logs + `_meta` |
| Endpoint 404 / no data / can't query | Endpoint or not-yet-synced | Step 4 → `_meta` + endpoint check |
| `reached the subgraph limit`, `database unavailable`, frozen with no log errors | Operational/quota (Goldsky-side) | Step 6 (escalate) |

### Step 4: Gather Diagnostic Data

Run these and analyze before concluding:

```bash
# Errors only — START HERE. Widen the window (e.g. --since 24h) if nothing shows.
goldsky subgraph log <name/version> --since 1h --filter error 2>&1

# Subgraph + tag + deployment status
goldsky subgraph list <name/version> 2>&1
```

> **Do not pull unfiltered logs.** Subgraphs emit a huge volume at `info`/`debug` level — running `goldsky subgraph log` without `--filter error` is slow and extremely token-hungry, and rarely adds signal over the error-filtered view. If you genuinely need non-error context, scope it tightly: a very short window (`--since 5m`) and, if possible, grep for a specific string. Lead with errors + the `_meta` query below.

Then run the **`_meta` query** against the GraphQL endpoint — this is the single most useful check for "stuck" or "no data" subgraphs. It reports the latest indexed block:

```graphql
{
  _meta {
    deployment
    hasIndexingErrors
    block { number hash timestamp }
  }
}
```

- `hasIndexingErrors: true` → a handler/mapping error halted indexing. Go to the error patterns below.
- `block.number` far behind the chain head → still syncing (or stalled). Compare against a block explorer.
- `block.number` **ahead of / not yet on** the chain → wrong network deployed (see below).

### Step 5: Match Error Patterns

#### Wrong network / contract on the wrong chain

**Symptoms:** Subgraph never produces data, or `_meta` shows a start/current block that doesn't exist yet on the target chain. Often the subgraph name hints at the intended chain.

**Cause:** The manifest's `network`/chain slug points at a different chain than intended, so the subgraph is waiting for blocks that haven't been mined.

**Fix:** Correct the `network` in `subgraph.yaml` (verify the exact chain slug against the supported-networks docs at `docs.goldsky.com/chains/supported-networks` — e.g. it's `liteforge`, not `litvm-testnet`) and redeploy a new version. Confirm the contract address actually exists on the target chain via a block explorer.

#### Deploy-time failures

The deploy command errors out and nothing gets created. Common cases:

| Error / symptom | Cause | Fix |
|-----------------|-------|-----|
| `no network <slug> found` | Wrong/unknown chain slug in `subgraph.yaml` | Use the correct slug from supported networks. |
| YAML parse error from `subgraph init` | Illegal characters in `--contract-name` (e.g. `:`, spaces from an explorer label) | Pass a clean name: `--contract-name PolymarketUMACTFAdapter`. |
| `subgraph must use a single apiVersion across its data sources. Found: 0.0.7, 0.0.9` | Mixed `apiVersion` across `dataSources`/`templates` | Unify `apiVersion` across the whole manifest. |
| `Interface '<X>' not defined` | Schema references an undefined interface | Define the interface in `schema.graphql`. |
| Timeseries/aggregation spec errors (`must have id field of type Int8`, `@unique` missing, `aggregations not supported in spec version 1.0.0`) | Schema uses timeseries/aggregations not valid for the spec version | Fix the `id` type to `Int8`, add `@unique`, or remove aggregations. |
| `A deployment with this name & version already exists` | Re-deploying the same `name/version` | Bump the version, or `goldsky subgraph delete <name/version>` then redeploy. |
| `curl ... | sh` install fails (Windows) | Install script is shell-only | Install via npm: `npm i -g @goldskycom/cli`. |

#### Handler / mapping errors (indexing halts)

**Symptoms:** `hasIndexingErrors: true`; logs show things like:
- `Mapping aborted at src/mappings/...: unexpected null in handler '<handler>' at block #<n>`
- `Subgraph error ... code: SubgraphSyncingFailure`
- `Token.load` failures / Heap (out-of-memory) errors
- WASM trap / "Handler skipped due to execution failure" (when `nonFatalErrors` is enabled)

**Cause:** A bug in the customer's AssemblyScript mappings — most often a null dereference. Classic case: an entity is never `.save()`d because the handler early-returns when a token's `decimals()`/`symbol()` reverts (non-ERC-20 contract), then a later handler `.load()`s that missing entity and panics.

**Fix:**
1. Identify the handler and block from the error.
2. Patch the mapping so it doesn't skip `.save()` on the null path (e.g. default `decimals` to a sentinel like `18`, persist the entity, skip downstream pricing).
3. Redeploy a new version and **rewind to the first affected block** so the missing entities re-initialize.
4. As a stopgap to keep the endpoint serving (incomplete) data while you fix it, `subgraphError: allow` lets queries return partial results.

> Goldsky-side caveat: a deterministic error with `nonFatalErrors` enabled may not auto-clear even after the underlying cause is resolved. If a subgraph stays errored after a correct redeploy, escalate (Step 6).

#### Stalled / auto-paused subgraph

**Symptoms:** Head stops advancing; Goldsky auto-pauses a stalled subgraph and emails you.

**Cause:** Often a handler error (above), sometimes a transient upstream RPC issue or a stale source chain.

**Fix:**
1. Check logs and `_meta` for errors first.
2. If it's a code bug, fix and redeploy. If it was transient, resume: `goldsky subgraph start <name/version>`.
3. If the source chain itself is stale (no new blocks on the explorer either), there's nothing to index — wait for the chain.

#### Upstream RPC errors

**Symptoms:** `eth_getLogs does not exist` / method-not-supported, or `Found no transaction for event` / block-number mismatches.

**Cause:** The chain's RPC provider is misbehaving or missing methods — not the subgraph. (Real case: a node stamped every log with the request's `fromBlock`, so graph-node couldn't match logs to blocks and went fatal.)

**Fix:** This is Goldsky/RPC-side. Confirm it's not a manifest issue, then escalate (Step 6) with the exact error and block number.

#### Endpoint / query problems

**Symptoms:** `404` on the GraphQL endpoint, "no data", or rate-limit errors.

- **404 / no data:** The subgraph may not be synced yet (check `_meta`), or the public endpoint is disabled. Verify the endpoint URL with `goldsky subgraph list <name/version>`. Don't assume an endpoint is live before the resource exists and has synced.
- **Public vs private:** If queries fail auth, the endpoint may be private. Toggle with `goldsky subgraph update <name/version> --public-endpoint enabled` (see `/subgraph-builder`).
- **Rate limits:** Default is ~50 requests / 10 seconds. Higher limits are sales/support-gated — escalate (Step 6); don't promise a specific new limit.

### Step 6: Present Diagnosis

```
## Diagnosis

**Subgraph:** <name/version>
**Network:** <chain>
**Symptom:** <one-line>

**Root cause:**
<what's wrong and why>

**Evidence:**
- <log line / _meta block number / error string>

**Recommended fix:**
1. <step>
2. <step>

**Prevention:**
<how to avoid it next time, if applicable>
```

**When to escalate to support@goldsky.com** (don't burn cycles guessing):
- Operational/quota issues not visible via CLI: `reached the subgraph limit` (especially if the count looks wrong), `database unavailable`, frozen head with no log errors.
- Upstream RPC bugs (`eth_getLogs does not exist`, log/block mismatches).
- A subgraph that stays errored after a verified-correct redeploy.

Give the user the exact info to send: subgraph `name/version`, project ID, the GraphQL endpoint, the error string, and the affected block number. Mention they can reference using the AI/MCP for priority handling.

### Step 7: Execute Fix

Offer to run fixes, and confirm before anything destructive:

- **Resume a paused subgraph:** `goldsky subgraph start <name/version>`
- **Pause for maintenance:** `goldsky subgraph pause <name/version>`
- **Redeploy a fixed version:** `goldsky subgraph deploy <name/new-version> --path .`
- **Redeploy with a rewind:** `goldsky subgraph deploy <name/version> --start-block <firstAffectedBlock>`
- **Delete and recreate (last resort, reindexes from scratch — warn the user):** `goldsky subgraph delete <name/version>` then redeploy.

After a fix, re-check `goldsky subgraph list <name/version>` and the `_meta` query to confirm the head is advancing again.

## Common mapping-code root causes (catch before redeploy)

When indexing halted on a handler/mapping error, the underlying cause is almost always one of these AssemblyScript mistakes. Check the mapping for them before redeploying — and recommend the **Subgraph Linter** (static analysis) plus Matchstick tests so they never reach a deploy again (see `/subgraph-builder` → `references/testing.md`):

| Root cause | Symptom it produces | Fix |
|------------|--------------------|-----|
| Unchecked `Entity.load(id)!` force-unwrap | `unexpected null in handler` panic when the entity is missing | Use get-or-create; never `!`-unwrap a `load`. |
| Early-return that skips `.save()` (often after a reverting `decimals()`/`symbol()` on a non-ERC-20) | later `.load()` panics; `Token.load`/Heap errors | Use `try_` calls, default the value, persist the entity, skip only downstream pricing. |
| Division without a zero guard | math abort / `unexpected null` | Wrap in a `safeDiv` (return 0 when denominator is 0). |
| Stale `.save()` after a helper already mutated the entity | overwritten/clobbered fields, wrong data (not always a crash) | Load once, mutate, save once; don't save a stale copy. |
| Per-event `eth_call` that reverts or is undeclared | slow indexing or `unexpected null` | Make it revert-safe (`try_`) and declare it (`specVersion 1.2.0`+). |

These are the *causes* behind the reactive symptoms in Step 5's "Handler / mapping errors". Fixing the code and rewinding to the first affected block is the durable fix.

## Important Rules

- Always gather data (logs + `_meta`) before diagnosing. Never guess.
- "The product is solid — most issues are customer-side." Check the obvious customer causes first (wrong network, mapping bug, schema/manifest error) before assuming a Goldsky-side problem.
- Never recommend `graphman`/`kubectl`/Datadog/database access to a customer. Escalate instead.
- Confirm before destructive commands (delete, reindex from scratch).
- Redeploying creates a new immutable version. Use tags so the frontend URL doesn't change (see `/subgraph-builder`).

## When Bash Is Not Available

Give one command at a time, explain what to look for, and proceed based on the user's pasted output. Always prefer running commands directly when Bash is available.
