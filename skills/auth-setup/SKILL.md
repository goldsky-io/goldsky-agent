# Goldsky Authentication & Project Setup

Set up the Goldsky CLI, authenticate your account, and configure projects for your pipelines and subgraphs.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] macOS, Linux, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- [ ] Internet connection
- [ ] Goldsky account (sign up at https://app.goldsky.com)

## Authentication Workflow

**Follow this workflow and verify each step. Execute commands and check results.**

### Step 1: Check CLI Installation

```bash
which goldsky && goldsky --version
```

**Success:** Path and version displayed (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/goldsky` and `13.2.0`)

**Not installed:** Tell the user to run this in their terminal:

```bash
curl https://goldsky.com | sh
```

This requires sudo password entry. Use AskUserQuestion to confirm installation:

```
Question: "Please run this command in your terminal to install the Goldsky CLI:"
Code block: curl https://goldsky.com | sh

Options:
1. Label: "Done, it's installed"
   Description: "I ran the command and the CLI is now installed"

2. Label: "I need help"
   Description: "I encountered an error during installation"
```

After confirmation, verify with `which goldsky && goldsky --version`.

### Step 2: Check Authentication Status

```bash
goldsky project list 2>&1
```

**Already logged in:** Output shows a table with project IDs and Names. Skip to Step 4.

**Not logged in:** Output contains `Make sure to run 'goldsky login'`. Continue to Step 3.

### Step 3: Token-Based Login

**Do NOT attempt interactive login.** Always use token-based authentication.

**Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for token input.** Simply ask the user to paste their token directly in the chat:

```
You're not logged in. Please paste your API token:

(Need a token? Go to https://app.goldsky.com → Settings → API Tokens → Create Token)
```

Wait for the user to paste their token in their next message.

**If user says they don't have a token or need help:**
Explain the steps:

1. Go to https://app.goldsky.com
2. Click Settings → API Tokens
3. Click "Create Token" and give it a name
4. Copy the token (it won't be shown again)

Then ask them to paste it.

**Once user provides the token:**
Log them in:

```bash
goldsky login --token USER_PROVIDED_TOKEN
```

### Step 4: Verify Login

**ALWAYS verify after login:**

```bash
goldsky project list
```

**Success:** Exit code 0, shows table with projects

**Failure indicators:**

- `Make sure to run 'goldsky login'` still appears
- `invalid token` or `unauthorized`

If verification fails, ask user to generate a new token and repeat Step 3.

## Completion Summary

After successful setup, provide a summary to the user:

```
## Setup Complete

**What was done:**
- ✓ Goldsky CLI installed (version X.X.X)
- ✓ Authenticated to Goldsky
- ✓ Connected to project: [project-name]

**Your available projects:**
[List projects from goldsky project list output]

**Next steps - try these skills:**
- `/secrets` - Set up credentials for pipeline sinks (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Kafka)
- Ask "create a pipeline" to start building data pipelines
- Ask "deploy a subgraph" to deploy a subgraph to Goldsky
```

| `goldsky logout`               | Remove local credentials        |                         |
| `goldsky project list`         | List all projects you belong to |                         |
| `goldsky project create`       | Create a new project            | `--name` (required)     |
| `goldsky project users list`   | List users in current project   |                         |
| `goldsky project users invite` | Invite user to project          | `--emails`, `--role`    |

## Common Patterns

### Create a New Project

```bash
goldsky project create --name "my-new-project"
```

### Invite Team Members

```bash
goldsky project users invite --emails user@example.com --role Editor
```

**Available roles:** `Owner`, `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`

### Switching accounts

```bash
goldsky logout
goldsky login
# MUST verify after: goldsky project list
```

## Error Patterns

| Pattern                             | Meaning                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Make sure to run 'goldsky login'`  | Not authenticated             |
| `invalid token` / `unauthorized`    | Token is incorrect or expired |
| `Permission denied` / `403`         | User lacks required role      |
| `token expired` / `session expired` | Need to re-authenticate       |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue             | Action                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Not logged in     | Prompt user for API token, use `goldsky login --token` |
| Invalid token     | Ask user to generate a new token in dashboard          |
| Permission denied | User needs role upgrade from project Owner/Admin       |
| Session expired   | Prompt for new token and re-authenticate               |

After authentication is complete, suggest next steps:

- **`/turbo-builder`** — Build and deploy a new pipeline interactively
- **`/datasets`** — Find the right dataset for your use case
- **`/secrets`** — Set up credentials for pipeline sinks (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Kafka, etc.)
